### ☁️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of fractal and Perlin noise to create terrain and cloud formations. 
 **Terrain** is generated using multiple octaves of Perlin noise. With more octaves, the terrain appears increasingly rugged and detailed.
The Perlin noise generator is designed to be flexible, adapting for general use. Results are controlled by the **Cloud Controller** and **Terrain Controller** to shape unique cloud and terrain visuals.
